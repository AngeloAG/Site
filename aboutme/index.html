        <p>You can call me just Angelo. I am from Mexico. My major is Software Engineering. I work remotely making mobile applications. And I want to become a Senior Developer</p>
        <p>This is my first semester here on campus. However, I made some credits in the online degree program of BYUI at Mexico, so technically I think I am a sophomore.</p>
        <p>I am single. From BYUI I like the enthusiasm all the professors have in their classes</p>
        <p>I enjoy playing board games with friends and family and I also enjoy trading card games  like Magic The Gathering and Pokemon TCG. My dream is to become a Pokemon Professor.</p>
        <p>I like music and play guitar. My favorites genres to play are Spanish and Mexican traditional music. They sound great and are a good challenge to practice.</p>
        <p>I want to improve my web design skills because I am not that good at making pretty websites. I am not that good with colors and style.</p>
        <p>I have been member all my life. And thinking about a quote or scripture. I think I like what Nephi said in 2 Nephi "...for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do." That remembers me that all I need to do is my best.</p>
