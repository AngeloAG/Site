      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I imagine a site where you can post your questions about rules and specific scenarios and have Pokemon Professors help you out. And a place to share your deck ideas and have others comment on what they think about it and give you suggestions. That would redefine the metagame.
        This is the opportunity to unite the global community and remake the way we play trading card games. Can you imagine the possibilities?

        For those that are new to the game here is an explanation of how it works.<br />

The Pokémon Trading Card Game is a strategy-based card game that is usually played on a designated play-mat where two players (assuming the role of Pokémon trainer) use their Pokémon to battle each other. Each player plays one Pokémon onto the field and attacks their opponent's Pokémon. A Pokémon that has sustained enough damage from attacks–that reaches or exceeds its HP–is referred to as being "Knocked Out". For each of the opponent's "Knocked Out" Pokémon the victor scores 1 Prize Card, although some special card mechanics grant up to 2 or 3 Prize cards in accordance with their higher hierarchy. Prize cards are primary win conditions, with the possession of six Prize cards being an instantaneous win. Other ways to win are by "Knocking Out" all the Pokémon the opponent has on their bench (i.e. the row behind the Active, fighting Pokémon that houses five additional Pokémon to supplant the active Pokémon if it retreats or is "Knocked Out") so the opponent has no Pokémon left, or if at the opponent's turn there are no cards left to draw into their deck.<br />

      <h3>Recommendations to build a deck.</h3>
      <p>
        Wanting to create your own game experience? Tired of those pre-made theme decks? Here we present not a “How to build your deck” but rather a recommendation guide to express your style through a deck. There is no “right” or “wrong” deck. The beauty of this game is that the possibilities are infinite, and the unique interactions that can be achieved are only limited to your imagination. <br />

The first thing you must consider is the format you want your deck to play in. That’s the major change factor in your decisions for the deck because (as in any other trading card game) cards are tied to different formats of the game, which means that some cards are allowed in a particular format and others are not. We have a separate section that explains the different formats the current game has and how to differentiate a card that is allowed or not on each. Keep in mind that and choose the format you want to build the deck for, that’s the first decision you should make.<br />

Next, here is what defines the overall structure of your deck, look at the cards you have, or look at the Pokemon Database for the different cards out there, and find the one you want to build your deck upon. Find the one that has the interesting ability or movement you want to be the base of your deck. It could be a card that does a lot of damage, one that poisons your opponent, or even one that devolves the opponent's pokemon, etc. Have fun choosing the card you like or the effects you think would be fun to explore. This will be the pillar of your new deck.<br />

Now, it gets a little bit more complex from here. The next task is to find a card that will enhance the power, movement, or ability of your main pokemon. For example, some pokemon allow you to poison your opponent’s pokemon once in a turn, this could be your main pokemon, then, you could look for a pokemon that doubles the amount of damage a poisoned pokemon receives, that’s a strategy now and it now becomes your support pokemon. The two pokemon will work together and leverage the power of the deck.<br />

Well, the deck needs to have 60 cards. What now? Now you need to create a structure for your deck. Now we have to find a motor that will move your deck throughout the game. Some pokemon have interesting abilities like “Discard a card and if you do draw 2 cards” or “When you evolve this pokemon look for a trainer in your deck”. That’s powerful, and that will allow you to travel through your deck and find what you need.<br />

And what about the trainers? That’s a good question, you cannot only rely on pokemon’s abilities, it would be too slow, that’s where trainers come in handy. Look for trainers that allow you to find in your deck what you need to power your deck. For example, if your main pokemon is a dark type pokemon, find trainers that help you with that kind of pokemon. Look for trainers that allow you to recover pokemon that were defeated in battle and make your library of trainers for your deck.<br />

Energies are a vital and tricky part. Most pokemon movements require energy to be performed, and that’s the guide here, look at the pokemon you have, find the movements that you will actually use in battle (you probably would not need all movements your pokemon are capable of), and sum them up, now you have an approximate of the amount of energy you will need to power your deck.<br />

      <h3>Formats and decks.</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the awesome world of the Pokemon Trading Card Game. This game works under the concept of a deck, a deck is a library or collection of cards that is the main unit of the game. You will always need a deck to play, as it is the way you interact and battle with other pokemon trainers. <br />

The question arises, What does a deck look like? And that’s where the other concept enters the stage, formats. Formats are what shape the game and therefore, the decks. There are formal formats recognized by Pokemon that are used for tournaments, and there are also formats made by players that got popularized and fun to play.<br />

Here is a description of the formats.
Standard.
This is (even if it sounds redundant) the standard format for the game, you may be asking, what does that mean? It is the format that aims to standardize the metagame and give to both experienced and new players balance. This format only allows cards from the most recent set and its expansions (that commonly go far back a year from the present time) with this, new players can easily get enough cards to play at a more stable price. Thus, if you are new to the game, you don’t need to have been playing for a long time in order to compete with other players, and if you have been playing for a long time then you need to evolve and keep up with the new cards (increasing the challenge). This game has banned cards that cannot be used on the game. Pokemon Inc. manages the list of banned cards.<br />

Expanded.
This format is meant for veterans of the game (but that does not mean new players cannot play it and enjoy it). Because it allows cards from up to 3 years ago. Getting some of those cards is really difficult and some others became expensive with the passing of time, but because of the big amount of available cards the possible interactions and combinations grow exponentially and become more complex. This format also have banned cards, the list is managed by Pokemon Inc.<br />

Unlimited.
This format, as its name implies, has no limits, all cards from all expansions are allowed and there are no bans. This game is even more complex than the Expanded format and with that, the difficulty of obtaining some cards increases too. It is extremely fun and chaotic to the point that some games last 30 minutes only having 2 turns played in the whole game. This format is recommended for experienced players, but of course, new players are welcome to play.<br />
